                <h2>Inspector</h2>

                <p>The inspector allows you to examine the elements of a native app in the same
                    style as you would with i.e. Firebug or the Chrome inspector.</p>

                <p>To access the inspector, set a breakpoint in the test code and execute it in
                    Debug mode.</p>


                <p>When the application has stopped there, open a browser and go to
                    <a href="http://localhost:5555/inspector/" target="_blank">http://localhost:5555/inspector/</a> (change the port to match the one you started
                    your server on)
                    <br/>You will see the app with its object tree displayed.</p>

                <p>Mouse over the element you're interested in to find its attributes and be able
                    to create locators.</p>

                <p>If you hit the &lt;ESC&gt;. button, an xpath helper will appear, giving you access to
                    real time validation of your xpath locators.</p>

            <div class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12">
                <a id="l10n" class="anchor"></a>

                <h2>Working with localized apps</h2>

                <p>The inspector also allows you to inspect the internals of an app, and access
                    its content files. Instead of using the content directly, you can use the key
                    the content was generated from. The tests using the keys will be independent from the localization
                    and more robust as content changes have no impact on the test itself.</p>

                <p>When an element's key is found by ios-driver, the inspector will turn blue
                    instead of the normal yellow, and some extra information will be displayed on
                    the right hand side. The 'key' attribute can be used to create localization
                    ready locators. </p>
                <p><strong>More information about how to write localization independent tests can be found <a href="documentation.html?page=native#l10n"> here.</a></strong></p>
